## What?
BowlingJS is an informal group of developers and techies who like to meet up monthly and throw bowling balls at pins whilst discussing code, hipster tech and community.

Likely discussion topics are: functional programming, compile to JavaScript languages, es6, promises and iojs... alongside more important things like where to get the best coffee.
